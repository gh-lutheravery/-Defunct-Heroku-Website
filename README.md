# Django-Blog
This is a proof of concept for a blogging website to showcase my skills. It features:

* Functional auth
* All basic backend operations with validation (fetching, sorting, filtering, etc.)
* AWS S3 storage of profile pictures
* Secure deployment in Heroku
* DRY source code

*Since heroku has disabled github intergration, this repo may not be up to date*
